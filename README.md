# github-dashboard

## Overview
This project is a locally running dashboard web application to help streamline management of Github repos and issues.
It is expected that you have the latest LTS version of [Node][] installed and its package manager, [NPM][].

[Node]: https://nodejs.org/
[NPM]: https://www.npmjs.com/

## Setup
After cloning the repo, please do the following

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run install:jspm`
3. Run `npm run install:typings`
4. Run `cp src/credentials.ts.tmpl src/credentials.ts` and replace the `xxx`'s with your Github username and a Github
_"Personal Access Token"_ with the following scopes:
-- repo
-- admin:org
-- notifications

## Architecture
This project is intended to be as closely aligned with modern day JavaScript standards and conventions by leveraging as
much from the ES6 / ES7 language specification.  The tools being used in the application are:

- [React][] - Component first UI library by Facebook.  This project will leverage [JSX].
- [SystemJS][] - Universal module loader, coming in ES7.  Polyfilled for now so we can use ES6 `import` for JS, with
a plugin installed to allow us to load CSS too.
- [JSPM] - ES6 forward thinking package manager to support SyatemJS instead of using [Bower][].  It can install packages
from Github or NPM and prepares them for being used in the browser.
- [TypeScript] - Super set of JavaScript, providing type support and more.  Added in version 0.4.0
- [NPM Scripts] - exposed Gulp tasks through npm, for simplicity.  Formalized in version 0.4.0

There is also intent to look into [Flux] and [Reactive] state management patterns, looking to libraries like [Redux]
and [Mobx].

## Project Layout

- _bootstrap_ - SystemJS bootstrap for the application
- _credentials_ - from a template, with Github credentials
- _components/_: UI components extending React.Component class
- _layouts/_: HTML views
- _stores/_: State management classes
-- _github/_: Manages a Github store for a given user, tracking
their profile, repositories and issues

## Running the App
`npm run app` - starts the app in a webrowser (with livereload)

## Development
1. In one tab run `npm run develop`
2. In another tab, run `npm run serve`

To see all available gulp tasks, run `npm run help`

**Note: For development, it is recommended to use an IDE like [Webstorm][], and install React / JSX plugins, as well
as setting any JavaScript language version settings to recognize ES6 or JSX syntax.**
